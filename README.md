# GTA Version Selector

For now only allow to downgrade GTA to ``mptuner`` dlc

## Download
[Latest release](https://github.com/Arochka/GtaVersionSelector/releases/latest)

## Usage

No installation required, just follow 3 steps:
- Indicate GTA 5 installation path
- Select the platform you use(Steam, Epic Games or Rockstar Launcher)
- Select the wanted action (Downgrade or Restore)

When you downgrade the game, a backup of overided files are made to ``backup`` directory.

## Troubleshoot

Rockstar Launcher is doing an integrity check each start, so you will have to downgrade each time.
If it start updating just launch the tool and use ``Restore`` action, Rockstar Launcher will be closed, just reopen it after and redo ``Downgrade`` action.
